# Whack A Mole

Download or clone repository and click the index.html file to run.

Whack A Mole game. Click start to play. The moles then pop out of their holes for a random amount of time and go back down again before another mole pops out of another hole. The hole that the mole comes out of is random for each pop-up too. 

When you click on the mole after it has popped out you get one point added to the scoreboard.

I added a timer function that counts how long is left in the game which is displayed and also a high score that is saved in local storage and updated whenever there is a new high score.
